# Inappbrowser for Android

![Archriss](http://image.prntscr.com/image/d20dd3d1415b47ebb533760328b431d8.png)

## Why ?

This is a simple fork of [the themeable browser plugin](https://github.com/initialxy/cordova-plugin-themeablebrowser) with the iOS imports removed from it since they're not up-to-date.

On iOS 7 & 8, use [this fork](https://github.com/archriss/inappbrowser-ios) which is the regular inAppBrowser plugin without the Android part.

On iOS 9 and up, just use [this beauty right here](https://github.com/Telerik-Verified-Plugins/SafariViewController).
